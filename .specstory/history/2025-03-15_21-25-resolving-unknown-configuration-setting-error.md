I'll look for information about this vibeCoder setting.

Based on my search, there's no official VS Code extension called "vibeCoder" that would use this configuration setting. This is likely causing the "Unknown Configuration Setting" error.

To resolve this issue:

---

```diff
  {
-     "vibeCoder.microphone": "Microphone (HyperX QuadCast)"
  }
```

---

I've removed the unknown setting. The error should be resolved now.

If you actually need microphone configuration for a VS Code extension, you'll need to:
1. Install the specific extension that uses this setting
2. Use the correct configuration name as specified in that extension's documentation
